# BHPC Workflow

This is intended to be a step-by-step guide to timing a BHPC event.  If you are not the [British Human Power Club](https://www.bhpc.org.uk), this may still be informative, but our somewhat arcane classification and scoring methods mean it diverges from typical CrossMgr workflow in important ways.

## Sign-on

This section intentionally left blank; we intend to revamp the Sign-on software, so there's little point in documenting the old one.

Suffice to say that you should use the sign-on system to generate an Excel file containing a sheet for each Race, with columns for the rider's name, RFID tag number and race categories.  See [DataMgmt][] for more details of the format.


## Criterium Race

## Time Trial

## Flying Sprint

## Scoring



# Glossary

To avoid confusion, we have tried to be consistent with the CrossMgr suite's use of terms like 'Bib' and 'Category' as much as possible.

Term|Meaning
:---|:------
Alias|In SeriesMgr, aliases are used to unify different spellings of a **rider**, **machine** or **team** name across a **series**, for when a rider appears as "Joe Bloggs", "Joe Blogs" and "Joseph B" in the results of different races.
Bell|In cycle racing, a bell is rung to indicate that a **rider** has one lap remaining.
Bib, number|A rider's race number, as printed on the side of their HPV, and used for manual entry into CrossMgr/SprintTimer
Carbon fibre|Lightweight composite material notable for its radio-blocking properties.  Do not attach RFID tags directly to carbon fibre.
Category|A class of rider (eg. Junior) or HPV (eg. Part-Faired).  In CrossMgr terms a [Category][Category Screen] is a list of bib numbers and associated meta-data that defines how they are timed and scored.
Class|Historical BHPC term equivalent to **category** that we try to avoid using.
Component Category|A sub-category that makes up a **Start Wave**.  We don't usually use these in BHPC racing, as unlike **CustomCategory** they cannot overlap.
Criterium|A type of cycle race where riders race for a certain period of time, and then complete an extra lap.  CrossMgr cannot handle this on its own, as it cannot know whether the leader will cross the finish line before or after the time period has elapsed until after it has happened.
CrossMgr|A software application designed for timing cyclocross races developed by Edward Sitarski.  The suite of applications that complement CrossMgr.
CrossMgrImpinj|A software application that allows **Impinj** **RFID** readers to be used with CrossMgr by emulating a **JChip** reader.
CrossMgrVideo|A software application that grabs short sequences of video from a **USB** camera and stores them in a database.  Used in combination with CrossMgr to collect time-stamped **finish line** images.
CustomCategory|CrossMgr term for an arbitrary [Category][Category Screen] that is used to generate a ranking, but does not control when riders start and finish.
DNF|*Did Not Finish* - status given to **riders** who fail to complete a **race**.
DNS (computing)|*Domain Name System* a system for resolving human-readable names like `www.bhpc.org.uk` to IP addresses like `92.53.241.24` and vice-versa, by querying a *DNS Server*.  A DNS server is not normally available at the track-side, so devices must be referred to by their IP address.
DNS (racing)|*Did Not Start* - status given to **riders** who fail to make it to the start line of a **race**.
DQ|*Disqualified* - status given to **riders** who will not be **ranked** due to some violation of TEH RULEZ.
Ethernet|The IEEE 802.3 standard for data communications (usually on twisted-pair cable, terminated with RJ45 modular connectors).  Ethernet is is typically used to carry TCP/IP.
Ethernet Switch|A device that forwards Ethernet packets from one wired network segment to another.  The **router** built into the flight-case with the BHPC's tag reader includes a 4-port Ethernet switch.
Event|In this context, a day of racing.  Particularly for **points** purposes.
Excel|A functional programming language masquerading as a piece of accountancy software that's commonly used for managing databases.  CrossMgr reads its **sign-on sheet** in Excel format, and can also use it to output results.
Fast Race|A BHPC **race** composed of mainly faster, or more experienced, riders.
Filtering|When CrossMgr ignores tag reads due to some internal logic  (eg. multiple tag reads occurring too close together to be distinct laps)
Finisher|Status given to **riders** who complete (or are expected to complete) a **race**.
Finish line|The place on the track where you set up your RFID aerials and finish line camera.  In BHPC events this is usually the same as the start line.
Finish order|The order in which **riders** cross the **finish line** at the end of a **race**.  This is the most important piece of race data, and if riders are close together cannot always be determined by **RFID** alone: Human observation or video evidence may be required.
Flag|A chequered flag is waved to indicate that riders are finishing the **race**.  We may refer to a rider 'getting the flag' when their race is over.
FTP(S), SFTP|*File Transfer Protocol (Secure)*, *SSHÂ File Transfer Protocol* - Protocols used for transferring files over a TCP/IP network.  CrossMgr uses this to upload results to a website.
Gender|In CrossMgr terms this may be one of 'Open', 'Women' or 'Men'.  Most BHPC [Categories][Category Screen] are 'Open'.
GPS|*Global Positoning System*.  A satellite navigation system that can be used to determine positions in space and time.
GPX (track)|A standard file format used by **GPS** receivers to record positions over a period of time.  Used by CrossMgr to draw the race animation, and to import lap times for riders.
Hexadecimal, Hex|Numbers in base 16 (0-F), rather than the usual base 10 (0-9).  Used for tag numbers.
HPV|*Human Powered Vehicle*, for example a bicycle, tricycle, handcycle, wheelchair, velomobile, streamliner or pedal car.
Impinj|The manufacturer of the **RFID** reader system we use for timing races, and by extension their tag/hardware/software/protocol ecosystem.
IP address|A numerical address used to uniquely identify a device on a **TCP/IP** network.
JChip|An electronic timing system designed for sports events.  CrossMgrImpinj converts **LLRP** data from the **Impinj** reader into JChip protocol data for CrossMgr.
Lap|One complete circuit of a race track.
Lapped|A **rider** who has become far enough ahead in a **race** that they overtake a rider who is logically still behind them is said to have *lapped* the slower rider.  Lapped riders are expected in BHPC races, due to the wide range of machines and athletic ability.
Lap Time|The **race time** at which a rider crosses the finish line at the end of a lap.  May be extrapolated in the event of a **missed read**.
Leader|The **rider** currently in first position of their **race** or **category**.
Licence|In CrossMgr, a (?unique) identifier of **rider** used in UCI-compliant bicycle racing.  The BHPC don't use this.
LLRP|*Low Level Reader Protocol*.  The protocol used to communicate with the Impinj RFID reader over the TCP/IP network.
Local Time|The **time of day** in the appropriate time zone (eg. *British Summer Time*).
Machine|Attribute of a **rider** used to record the name of their HPV.
Mass Start|A **race** where multiple riders start at the same time.  Contrast with **Time Trial**.
Mechanical|When a **rider** stops during a **race** due to a problem with their **HPV**.  They may resolve the problem and continue, or opt to **DNF**.
Merge|A BHPC process for combining the results of multiple **races** to determine the results of a single **round**.
Merge-O-Matic|Deprecated **Excel** macro used for combining BHPC race results in Excel format.  This functionality is now built into CrossMgr.
Missed Read|When a rider crosses the **finish line**, but the **RFID** system doesn't detect their **tag**.
MultiReader|**Impinj** application that is useful for testing and for changing the tag number of RFID tags.
NP|*Not Placed* - Non-judgemental status given to **riders** who should not be **ranked** for some reason (eg. you know that their lap times are incorrect).
(S)NTP|*(Simple) Network Time Protocol*.  A protocol used by computing devices to synchronise their **real time clocks** over a **TCP/IP** network.
Points|Points are calculated by SeriesMgr.  Points mean prizes.
Points Structure|In SeriesMgr, a Points Structure is a mapping of rankings to numbers of **points**.  You can have a different points structure for each round.
PowerCon|A rugged electrical connector often used for providing AC power to professional audio equipment.  Notable for being weatherproof and having a twist-lock latching action.
Publish|In CrossMgr terms, the act of producing (and optionally uploading) race results in an easily-read format.
PUL|*Pulled* - status given to **riders** who have been removed from a **race** by officials, typically for being too slow.
Race|An instance of people rushing about on bicycles.  A CrossMgr `.cmn` data file pertaining to a **race**.  Contrast: **round**, **event**.
RaceDB|A software application for managing race entries and results written by Edward Sitarski.  The BHPC were unable to use this, as its handling of categories is too inflexible.
Race Clock|In this context, a device built by Kim Wall in 2021 to display the Race Time on a large LED display at BHPC events.  The Race Clock is also available as a web page on the CrossMgr local webserver.
Race Time|Time elapsed since the start of a race.  Compare with **Time of Day**
Ranking|A list of riders in order of winningness.  Not the same as *finish order*, as riders are likely to be on different laps.
Real Time|In computing, the processing of data quickly enough to keep up with it as it happens.  Perhaps unintuitively, CrossMgr does not process timing data in real time.  As such, the timing computer becoming slow to process data due to being overloaded does not normally affect the accuracy of recorded lap times, even if the user interface becomes sluggish.
Real Time Clock (RTC)|A subsystem of a computing device that keeps track of the **time of day**.  Often physically distinct from other time sources that coordinate the internal operation of the computer.  Electronic race timing relies on synchronising (or at least, accounting for the discrepancy between) multiple real time clocks.
Results|The outcome of a **race** or **round**.  Will include ranking and time data, but not **points**.  Those are allocated later.
RFID|*Radio Frequency Identification*.  In this context a long-range high-throughput tag system suitable for tracking vehicles, warehouse inventory and sports timing, rather than the short-range systems used for card-entry type applications.
Rider|A participant in a **race**.
RJ45|The cheap plastic modular connectors used on twisted-pair **Ethernet** cables.  Notable for requiring special tools to fit, and having an easily-broken retaining tab.  RJ45 connectors do not react well to being dropped in mud.
Round|A particular type of **race**.  For example "30 minute criterium" "1-lap time trial".  At BHPC **events**, a **round** may be composed of more than one **race**, as the BHPC often splits the group for safety reasons.
Router|A device that forwards **TCP/IP** packets from one network to another.  The router built into the flight-case with the BHPC's tag reader is not actually used as a router; it is configured to work as an **Ethernet switch** and **WiFi** **access point**.
Series|A championship table for a racing season or **event**.  A SeriesMgr `.smn` file pertaining to a series.
SeriesMgr|A software application designed for allocating scores to a **series** of **race** results.  Part of the CrossMgr suite.
Sign-on sheet|An **Excel** file containing details of riders, used by CrossMgr to populate the [categories][Category Screen] table and look up rider's names, teams, etc.  Crucially, this is needed in order to match **tags** to **riders**.
Slow Race|A BHPC **race** composed of mainly slower or less experienced riders.
Sprint|A **time trial** run over a very short distance, usually with a flying start.  Due to the high speeds involved, precision timing equipment is needed to judge sprint events; the **Impinj** **RFID** system is not precise enough.
Sprint Time|The duration (ie. **race time**) of a **sprint**.
SprintTimer|A software application designed for timing flying sprints, written in 2023 by Kim Wall of the BHPC.  It borrows heavily from CrossMgr's codebase.
Sprint Timer Unit|A precision timing device designed for timing flying sprints, built in 2023 by Kim Wall of the BHPC.
Start Time|The **time of day** that a **mass start** **race** started at, or the **time of day** that individual **rider** started at in a **time trial** or **sprint**.
Start Wave|A CrossMgr term for a [Category][Category Screen] that defines a group of **riders** who start the **race** at the same time.  We would normally have a single Start Wave in a **race**.
Stopwatch|A standalone timing device that you can use to time **races** when you don't trust CrossMgr.
Stray tag|An **RFID tag** which has been within range of the **RFID** aerials for some time.  Usually an unused tag in the box of timing equipment, or a tag attached to a rider's helmet or HPV that has been left near the **finish line**.  Stray tags matching the **tag number** of a **rider** in the current **race** can cause all sorts of problems.
Tag|A physical RFID tag (as stuck to a rider's HPV or helmet), or the Product ID number encoded onto it.  Tag numbers are sent to CrossMgr whenever a tag passes within range of the **RFID** aerials.
Tape Switch|An momentary electrical switch in a long, flat format that may be operated by pressure at any point along its length.  These can be used to trigger a timing device when a wheel passes over them.
TCP/IP|*Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol*.  The de-facto standard protocol for computer networking.  Used by the CrossMgr suite applications to communicate with each other and with external hardware over **Ethernet** or **WiFi**.
Team|In CrossMgr, a Team is an attribute of a **rider**.  **Points** may be calculated on a team basis.
Time of day, Wall time|The time of day, possibly including the date.  May be UTC or in the local timezone.  Contrast with **Race time**.
Time Trial|A type of **race** where **riders** start at different times, and compete against the clock.
Trigger|Something that causes CrossMgrVideo to record a snippet of video in its database.  Triggers may come from CrossMgr over **TCP/IP**, manually from the mouse or keyboard, or via a **USB** device.
Trigger-O-Matic|A hardware device that generates HID joystick button events that trigger CrossMgrVideo.  This provides a nice big physical button that can be pressed quickly regardless of what the computer is displaying at the time, and an interface for a tape-switch or optical beam-break device.
USB|*Universal Serial Bus*.  A standard system for connecting computing equipment that is frequently used to provide power to small electronic devices.
USB-A|The large, flat USB connector typically used on desktop computers and 'wall-wart' power supplies.
USB-B|The large square USB connector usually found on printers and scanners.  The Trigger-O-Matic, Race Clock and Sprint Timer Unit have USB-B connectors in the interests of durability.
USB-C, Micro USB-B, Mini USB-B|Various (incompatible) smaller USB connectors, usually found on small battery-powered computing devices like mobile phones and **GPS** receivers.  Some laptops use USB-C as a power connector, but notably not the Acer Aspire 5 that the BHPC uses for race timing at the time of writing; its USB-C port is for data only.
UTC|*Universal Time Coordinated*.  A pedant would point out that it's not technically the same thing as *Greenwich Mean Time*, but effectively that.  Software that has any sense tends to work with UTC internally, and only convert to local time for input and output.
Webserver|CrossMgr and SprintTimer run a local web server on port `8765`.  This can be used to view live results or the **race clock**.
WiFi|In this context, the IEEE 802.11 standard for Ethernet-like data communications over spread-spectrum radio.
WiFi Access Point|The base station of a **WiFi** network.  Usually bridges to a wired **Ethernet** network.
XLR|A latching electrical connector commonly used for signals on professional audio, video and lighting equipment.  It is robust and easily repaired in the field.
