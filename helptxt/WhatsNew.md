# What's New in CrossMgr

## Apr, 2024

Added Early Bell features.  All riders after the Early Bell will be on their last lap.

Early Bell can be set from the [Chart][] page, or from the [SetLaps][] dialog in the [Record][] page.

Setting Early Bell from the two screens makes sense.  On the Record page, you can set the time immediately.
On the Chart page, you can plan the best time to set an Early Bell based on the position of riders.

When Early Bell is set, riders will correctly show the Bell symbol in the Expected list.
