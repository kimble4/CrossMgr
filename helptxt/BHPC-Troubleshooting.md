# BHPC Troubleshooting

This document is intended to help BHPC volunteers resolve problems with the race timing system.  If you are not the [British Human Power Club](https://www.bhpc.org.uk), then much of this won't make sense.  It has been added to the CrossMgr help so that it is easily accessible during races.

Topics are listed in approximate order of urgency.  The search facility may be useful!

## Before the race

### Changing a rider's race categories

This can be done in the sign-on system, or by editing the racers spreadsheet.  (See [A rider has changed their Category/Machine/Timing tags][Category Changes] for details.)  If you edit the spreadsheet your changes will be lost if it is re-written by the sign-on system.  Be careful with the spelling of category names, if they do not match, additional categories will be created.

This may be done retrospectively, so if you're short of time, make a pen & paper note of the change, and worry about it after the race.

### Moving a rider between fast and slow groups

As above, this can be done in the sign-on system or by editing the spreadsheet.  (See [Moving a rider to a different race within a round
][Race Reallocation] for details.)  If done by editing the spreadsheet be sure to change the rider's EventCategory to match the destination race, otherwise CrossMgr will put them in their own start wave.


## During the race

### If in doubt: Shoot video

The golden rule for when things go wrong during the race is that **if in doubt, get someone to video the riders crossing the finish line** (as a continuous recording) with a phone or whatever.  Have the race clock visible at some point in the recording so time indexes can be synced up later.

If CrossMgrVideo is functioning, manually triggering it will achieve this in an easier to process way.

### Tags aren't reading

Yellow times on the [Results][] page are extrapolated times.  **If everything is coming up yellow, it means that tags are not being read!**

#### For a specific rider...

Check [RiderDetail][].   Does the rider exist?  (If not, check the sign-on sheet.)

Check the list of lap times...

##### If times are being recorded, but filtered:

- Check the **minimum possible lap time** (see [Properties/Race Options][Race Options])
- If spurious reads are being accumulated, search the area around the finish line for spare tags/helmets/bikes.  Ensure that unclaimed tags are in the RF-blocking bag.
- If the track layout means that riders pass close to the finish line on the far section of the track (eg. Stourport, occasionally Lancaster), their tags may be picked up twice.  This is not a problem when they pass through the finish line first (eg. anticlockwise at Stourport), as the **minimum possible lap time** filtering will ignore the subsequent read.  In the other direction, however, it can cause chaos with inconsistent lap times.  The only real solution (other than spending a lot of time inspecting video) is to reduce the performace of the offending RFID aerial.  (We've found that using the desktop aerial facing **upwards** at the trackside gives a range of about 3 metres horizontally, which works as a near-side aerial at Stourport.)

##### If times are not being recorded, check CrossMgrImpinj:

Are their tags being read?|Resolution
:----|:---------
Yes|Check the rider's details in the sign-on sheet - are the 'Tag' field(s) correct?
No|Probably a dodgy, badly positioned or missing tag.  (Has the rider removed a hood or fairing with the tags attached?)  Enter the rider's times manually until the end of the race.
Yes, but it's the wrong number|You can change this in the sign-on sheet and it will be applied retrospectively.
The tag is listed as 'stray'|A tag with the rider's number is within range of the RFID aerials and has been for some time.  Remove it from the area or place it in the RF-blocking bag.
The tag is being 'skipped'|As above.  Can also be a symptom of the tag reader's clock drifting into the future with respect to the computer's.  Try pressing 'reset' in CrossMgrImpinj.  If this solves the problem, you have a clock drift issue, try enabling "**Recalculate clock offset as tag reads are reported**" or setting "**Repeat Seconds**" to zero in CrossMgrImpinj's Advanced settings.

#### For everyone...

Check there are riders in the race.  There could be a problem with the sign-on sheet.

Otherwise, this is likely a problem with the RFID system.

##### RFID troubleshooting

**Check CrossMgrImpinj is running**

The CrossMgrImpinj helper application is required for CrossMgr to communicate with the tag reader.

**Communications with tag reader**

If the left pane of the CrossMgrImpinj screen is green, skip to the next section.

If the left pane of the CrossMgrImpinj screen is red, it means that it is not connected to the tag reader.  The connection failures may show an error message which may or may not be informative.

Check that the `IP` radio button is selected, and that the (reader's) address is set to `192.168.1.250`

If this is correct, then you have some sort of networking problem between the laptop and tag reader.  Network diagnostics are a complicated subject with a need for more than one highlighter pen, but check:

- That the router and tag reader have power
- That the laptop is connected to one of the external ethernet ports on the flightcase
- That the power LED on the tag reader is GREEN
![Tag reader LEDs](./images/aerial_connections.jpg "Tag reader Status and Power LEDs (right)")
- That the status LED on the tag reader is GREEN (when ready and idle), or flashing ORANGE (when the reader is operating)
- That the power LED on the router is solid GREEN (flashes during bootup)
![Router LEDs](./images/router_blinkenlights.jpg "Router LEDs")
- That the Ethernet LED on the router labelled "RFID Reader" is lit up (flashing to show activity is good)
- That the LEDs on the tag reader's Ethernet port are also lit
- That the Ethernet LED on the router corresponding to the RJ45 port the laptop is connected to is lit (flashing to show activity is good)
- Can you ping the tag reader?  Type `ping 192.168.1.250` in a command prompt window on the laptop and see if it gets a response
- Can you access the tag reader's web interface on [http://192.168.1.250/](http://192.168.1.250/cgi-bin/index.cgi) from the laptop?
- If you can't ping the tag reader, can you ping the router?  Type `ping 192.168.1.254` in a command prompt window on the laptop and see if it gets a response
- Can you access the router's web interface on [http://192.168.1.254/](http://192.168.1.254/) from the laptop?
- If you can't ping the router either, is there some sort of Windows problem preventing the Ethernet port from working.  Check the output of `ipconfig /all`, the section pertaining to the wired Ethernet port should look like:
>Ethernet adapter Ethernet:  
Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :

NetBIOS over Tcpip. . . . . . . . : Enabled  

If there is a problem between the laptop and the router, you will not be able to reach the tag reader.  Try power-cycling the router (it takes a minute or so to boot).  Try another Ethernet cable.  If it's hopeless, try connecting an Ethernet cable directly between the laptop and the tag reader's Ethernet port.  (If you do this, the race clock will no longer work, as it will not be connected to the laptop.)

If you can reach the router but not the tag reader, try power-cycling the tag reader.  Again, it takes a minute or so to boot.

**Communications with CrossMgr**

Assuming CrossMgrImpinj is connected to the tag reader successfully, is it forwarding tag reads to CrossMgr?

During a race or RFID test, CrossMgr listens for connections from a JChip-type tag reader on port `53135`.  CrossMgrImpinj connects to this socket and forwards tag reads in the JChip format.

The right pane of the CrossMgrImpinj window turns green when the connection is established.  If it is red and shows connection timeouts, this means that CrossMgr is not listening.  *This is normal if the race is unstarted*, in order to prevent problems caused by having multiple copies of CrossMgr open simultaneously.

- Check the CrossMgr Address (top right) is set to `127.0.0.1` (this is the loopback address of the local machine)
- In CrossMgr, go to [Properties/RFID][RFID].  Check that "**Use RFID reader During Race**" is enabled.  Click "**Setup/Test RFID Reader...**"
- Check the reader type is set to "**JChip/Impinj/Alien**"  The remote IP address and port fields will be greyed out, because CrossMgr does not originate the TCP/IP connection when using the JChip protocol.  If a race is not in progress, start an RFID test.  You should see a connection established in the Messages pane.
- Go back to CrossMgrImpinj.  At this point a connection to CrossMgr should be established and the right pane should have turned green.  If it isn't working, try restarting CrossMgrImpinj and CrossMgr.
- If all else fails, it's always worth rebooting Windows.

### Trigger-O-Matic isn't triggering

- Ensure the **Auto-Capture** toggle switch is not in the 'disable' position.
- The IR beam-break is a useful backup against RFID problems, but isn't reliable when the track is wide (eg. Darley Moor) or in bright sunlight.  The 'auto capture' push button will trigger a recording manually, and its use should be encouraged for close finishes and where a rider's tags aren't reading.
- The Trigger-O-Matic is compatible with the sprint timer's tape switches.  They might be an alternative option?

### CrossMgrVideo isn't receiving triggers from CrossMgr

- Ensure that "**Photos on Every Lap**" is enabled in [Properties/Camera][Camera].
- This stopped working once during the 2023 season, and we have not been able to reproduce the behaviour.  Restarting CrossMgrVideo solved the problem in that instance, so try that?

### Murky images in CrossMgrVideo

The finish line camera has a manual aperture.  If the amount of ambient light changes markedly due to Weather, it may need adjusting to avoid over or under exposure:

![Camera focus and aperture adjustment](./images/finish_line_camera.jpg "Camera focus and aperture adjustment")

- While watching the CrossMgrVideo preview window, open the cover of the camera enclosure and gently rotate the aperture ring.  (This is the part in the middle of the lens that does not have a locking 'peg' on it.  The focus and zoom settings should not normally require adjustment.)
- Ensure the camera is correctly aligned with the finish line** after closing the cover.

### Power failure

If AC power (eg. from a generator or inverter) fails, the laptop will continue to operate on its internal battery.  The laptop powers the camera and Trigger-O-Matic (or sprint timer unit), and should be sufficient for a couple of hours.  If a USB-C power bank that is able to power a laptop is available, there is an adaptor in the laptop bag to convert USB-C to the tiny Acer DC barrel jack.

The RFID tag reader, wireless router and GPS time source are powered by a redundant power supply.  If a DC (battery) source is present, they will continue to operate on DC power when the AC power fails.  If enabled, the AC power failure alarm should sound, and CrossMgrImpinj will pop up a warning message.  The race clock is powered by AC power alone, and will cease functioning.

![AC power failure](./images/AC_power_failure.jpg "AC power failure")

- To avoid risk of damage from voltage fluctuations, **disconnect all the timing equipment before attempting to restart a generator**.  Reconnect only after the generator output has stabilised.
- If power to the tag reader and router was completely lost, keep an eye on CrossMgrImpinj and make sure the connection to the tag reader is restored on boot-up (the old laptop had a quirk in its Ethernet driver whereby the USB dongle needed to be hot-plugged before it would bring up the connection).
- When AC power is successfully restored, remember to re-enable the power failure alarm for next time.
- If the redundant power supply fails, the router (15V, centre positive) and tag reader (24V, centre positive) may be powered by their own wall-wart adaptors.  The tag reader may also be powered using 802.3af Power-over-Ethernet from a suitable 48V injector or POE switch.

### Results look wrong

**Yellow times on the [Results][] page are extrapolated times.**  They are CrossMgr's best guess when it doesn't have a valid lap time to go on.  Don't be fooled into thinking that everything is working because you see yellow lap times.

#### Slash isn't winning

- Is it the slow race?
- Check the minimum lap time?
- Has another rider left a timing tag near the start line to accumulate spurious reads?
- Has he crashed into a hedge?
- Problem with the fundamental laws of physics?

#### CrossMgr only recording alternate laps

This is usually caused by the **minimum possible lap time** (see [Properties/Race Options][Race Options]) being set too high.  Typically a value that worked for the slow race is then too high for the faster riders in the fast race.

#### Incorrect ranking in live results

If [ranking by average speed][Race Options], ensure that all [Categories][Category Screen] have a lap distance set.  (CrossMgr's [Results][] page does not use average speed ranking while the race is in progress, so only the HTML output will be affected.)

#### Two leaders / Rider in their own start wave

Likely someone has edited the sign-on sheet to move a rider from one race to another and not updated their EventCategory accordingly.  Fix the sign-on sheet.

#### Fixed-laps race: CrossMgr seems to stop recording times early

Check the "**Lapped Riders Continue**" settings in the [Category Screen][].  In a time-based race, you'd normally want everyone to finish on the leader's last lap, so this would be unset.  In a distance based race, you'd want to set this so that all riders have to complete the full number of laps.

#### Time trial: False start

- In a manually/RFID started time trial you can [delete a rider from the race][Edit Rider] and start them again.  (This does not delete the rider from the sign-on sheet; CrossMgr will recognise their bib number/RFID tags if they reappear.)
- Alternatively, a safer approach (for example, if a rider is having a second attempt after a crash) is to time them with a stopwatch, pen and paper then fudge the results afterwards.
- If multiple riders want a second attempt, it may be worth using [New Next][File] to create a separate race file for second attempts, and manually combining the data later.  (Alternatively, consider running a [Best n Laps][Category Screen] event.)

#### Spurious RFID reads during sprints

If someone brings their timing tags near the RFID aerials during a sprint event, they can accidentally claim another rider's times.  This is worse than loitering near the finish in mass-start races, as it isn't just their own results that are affected.

The best approach is vigilance, and to correct (or clear) the 'bib' field of the affected sprints as soon as possible.  Use the 'note' field to explain what happened.

If necessary you can identify the true rider using CrossMgrVideo after the event.

### There's an error message...

#### From CrossMgr

I can't think of any error messages that CrossMgr generates during a race?

#### From CrossMgrImpinj

CrossMgrImpinj is the application that allows CrossMgr to communicate with the Impinj RFID reader.  It can produce warning messages if something goes wrong with the RFID system.  It also monitors the redundant power supply via the tag reader's GPIO port.

Error|Course of action
:----|:---------
Tag reader has disconnected (red pane on left)|Check the tag reader and router have power.  Check the relevant Ethernet blinkenlights.  Check the wiring.  Try resetting CrossMgrImpinj.  Attempt TCP/IP diagnostics using `ping` and/or a web browser (FireFox has shortcuts to the router and tag reader's web interfaces).  Power-cycle whatever isn't working and pray.
Not connected to CrossMgr (red pane on right)|This is normal if no race or RFID test is in progress; CrossMgr only listens for connections during a race or test.  If the race is running but it still fails to connect, check the [RFID properties][RFID] in CrossMgr.
An aerial has disconnected|Check the coaxial cables to the aerials.  Try another cable (coax is easily damaged, and water ingress through a nick in the jacket will obliterate its RF performance).  Reset CrossMgrImpinj.
AC power has disconnected|Check the AC power meter and blinkenlights to confirm.  Check the relevant power wiring.  Check that the generator is working (fuel/oil supply) and is on a level surface; that the battery is not depleted or that the mains supply hasn't tripped out or been switched off / unplugged at the far end.  Beware of hoovers and tea urns.
A DC power source has disconnected|Check the battery is not depleted (bear in mind that the DC power supply does not charge the batteries).  Check that a USB power bank has not gone to sleep due to negligable current draw.  Check the relevant power wiring.

#### From CrossMgrVideo

CrossMgr will warn if the camera disconnects.  Check the USB cable to the camera (there is a small weatherproof inline connector at the camera end), and that CrossMgrVideo hasn't switched to using the internal webcam.  Restart CrossMgrVideo if necessary, reconfigure the camera if necessary, and check the alignment/focus/aperture.

CrossMgrVideo will begin listening for triggers as soon as it has started up.

#### From Windows

##### Not Responding

While it may become (harmlessly) sluggish at busy times, CrossMgr freezing or going "Not Responding" is bad.  If it doesn't recover within 30 seconds, it's better to kill the process and restart CrossMgr than to continue waiting.  Under normal circumstances, CrossMgr writes race data to disk every minute, so you won't lose the whole race if you have to kill the process and restart.  If CrossMgrImpinj is still working, it will continue to log tag reads to its own file, so lost data can be reconstructed with a bit of effort.

Historically CrossMgrVideo would go "Not Responding" during intensive database access.  It would eventually recover on its own.  Setting it to 'Fast Preview' mode should avoid this happening.

##### Virus warnings

Windows Defender sometimes false-positives on the CrossMgr suite applications and warns that they are a virus.  Do not allow it to remove/quarantine the applications, otherwise you're going to have a really bad day.  (With any luck, there's still a copy of the installer files in the Downloads directory.)

##### Windows update

This *should* be set to not install updates during racing hours.  Don't be tempted to start a race while it's pestering for updates, in case it decides to unilaterally reboot the system.  Better to make everyone wait while Windows restarts.

### Dealing with DNFs

The best approach is to make a pen & paper note of the rider's bib number and approximate DNF time before touching [RiderDetail][].  The DNF time can always be entered retrospectively after the race if you are busy or unsure.

Keep an eye out for DNF riders deciding to resume the race, and for riders who haven't told you they've DNFed sneaking around behind the timing tent and generating spurious RFID reads.  Newbie riders may be confused by the bell and DNF on the last lap.  Experienced riders may overcook it and crash or have a mechanical failure on the last lap.

In a fixed-laps race, it's better to set riders who abandon to PUL rather than DNF, so that they get credit for the laps they've completed.

### Race clock issues

As long as it has power and a WiFi signal the race clock *should* operate without any user intervention.

When CrossMgr is running, the clock should connect to the WebSocket for the lap counter, and the `WebSock` LED will illuminate.  During the race, the `Net Act` LED should flash approximately once per second, as the race data is refreshed.

Problem|Course of action
:----|:---------
LED display is blank|Check the LCD and `Power` blinkenlight for evidence of power.  Ensure the PowerCon mains power connector has been twisted clockwise to engage.  If the LCD is active but nothing appears on the LED display, this is probably a hardware fault.
LED displays `i2cEr`, LCD blank or corrupt|Internal problem with the clock electronics.  Try pressing 'reboot' or cycling power.  If it persists, it may be a hardware fault.
Time and temperature displayed but not race time during race|Check the race is running.  Check the display on the back of the clock and confirm that it has a WiFi connection to the `BHPC_Timing` SSID (as broadcast by the wireless router in the flightcase with the tag reader).  The `WiFi` LED should illuminate steadily to indicate a connection.  If it fails to connect, check the router is operating and that its 2.4G WiFi LED is lit.  Perhaps move the clock closer to the router.
WiFi connected, but still no race time|If the `WebSock` LED does not light, the clock's connection to the CrossMgr PC may be misconfigured.  Check the clock documentation for more information.
Incorrect time of day|This should resolve itself automatically within a couple of minutes of connecting to the laptop and/or GPS time source via the wireless network.  The clock has its own battery-backed real-time clock; if this happens repeatedly the battery may need replacing.
Incorrect race time|This should only happen if the network connection has been lost during a race, and even then it should only drift by a matter of seconds.  Check the wireless router and try rebooting the clock or cycling power to re-establish the connection.  Otherwise, something may have gone hideously wrong with CrossMgr, and you have more important issues to deal with.
Race time 'jumps'|Not a fault; the latency of the connection to CrossMgr is unpredictable, and the time may be stepped if it drifts too far.
LED display corrupted (part of it refreshing, while other parts remain unchanged)|This is a hardware fault, likely with one of the dozens of delicate solder joints that make up the LED display, and not the sort of thing that can be repaired at the track-side.  Disconnect the power so that riders aren't mislead by the corrupt display.
Clock rotates in the wind|The interface with the clock stand is keyed to prevent rotation by means of an allen bolt protruding from the end of the stand.  Ensure that the bolt has aligned with the hole in the bottom of the 'top hat' by slowly rotating the clock on the stand until you feel it drop into place.  Further rotation is still possible by hand (at risk of damage to the retaining pins), but the additional friction of the stand's clamps should be sufficient to keep it in place.  If the wind is particularly strong, remove the clock from the stand so it can't fall over.
No rider number for sprint|Not a fault.  The sprint timer did not supply a bib number, perhaps because it could not identify the rider.
No unit for sprint speed|Not a fault.  There's no good way to display a 'k' or an 'm' on a 7-segment display without resorting to Braille.  The unit will be whatever the sprint timer is set to.

The 'reboot' button will reboot the clock and immediately attempt to re-establish the connection.

If the network connection is not available, the clock may be operated manually as a simple stopwatch using the Start/Stop/Clear buttons.  When operating as a manual stopwatch all network functions are disabled.

### Live results not updating

Don't get too deep in the weeds troubleshooting live results issues during the race; collecting high-quality timing data is your priority!

Check the laptop has internet access.  (Is it connected to a WiFi network or hotspot?)  The upload process will use exponential backoff - if the connection is very slow it may update very infrequently.

Check the CrossMgr [FTP properties][FTP].  If the settings are correct, this is probably a problem with the internet connection.  (It's very easy to get the FTP path wrong.)

If the index page does not link to the current race, results may be uploaded but people won't be able to find them; [re-publish the index.html][Batch Publish].


## After the race

First, **back up all the race data**.  I like to create a .zip archive of the day's files before correcting and merging race results.

### Race duration issues

Setting the [race minutes][General Info] for a criterium isn't an exact science.  Usually you want the next integer minute after the leader gets the bell, but you may need to tweak this if it gives the wrong number of laps.  If the lap times are less than a minute (eg. on a velodrome) you may need to remove some lap times to make it work.  Fixed duration or laps races avoid this issue, but criteriums remain inexplicably popular.

### Problems merging races

Warnings that a rider is in both races are *probably* just because they've loitered near the finish line during the other group's race.  The spurious lap times will be filtered out automatically in the usual way (as they should occur before the start or after the finish of the rider's start wave), and are therefore harmless.

If something serious goes wrong during a merge it probably needs Kim to meditate on the data with the aid of a full Python development environment.  If that's not an option, you may have to [export to Excel][Batch Publish] and attempt to combine the results using spreadsheets or something.

### Ranking seems wrong

If ranking by average speed, ensure that all [Categories][Category Screen] have a lap distance set.

### Spurious (Women) categories in SeriesMgr table

A catgeory's gender has been set incorrectly in one of the race files, causing a new category to be created (look at who is ranked in it to work out which race).  CrossMgr sometimes interprets categories with only female riders as being women's categories when they should be 'Open'.  Fix the [Categories][Category Screen] in the relevant race, and refresh the results.


## Misc

### Clock synchronisation

Race timing depends on being able to synchronise the real-time clock in the tag reader (and where applicable, sprint timer) with that of the laptop.  While clock drift is negligible over the course of a race, this is complicated when Windows has a connection to the wider internet, allowing it to synchronise with an NTP server.  Symptoms of clock drift include triggers being offset in CrossMgrVideo and tag reads being erroneously 'skipped' by CrossMgrImpinj.

In an attempt to mitigate these problems, our version of CrossMgrImpinj has been modified to provide the ability to monitor and correct the offset between the laptop and tag reader's clock in real time, rather than just on initial connection.

Additionally, a GPS-based stratum 1 NTP time server has been installed in the flightcase with the tag reader.  Once it has obtained a time signal, the laptop, router, tag reader and race clock should synchronise their real-time clocks to it over the course of a few minutes.  If this is done before the start of a race, everything should stay synchronised to within a few milliseconds.  On this basis, it is important to power up the flightcase as early as possible in the setup process, so it may begin to acquire a GPS fix.

### Dodgy Ethernet cable

If you need to mate an XLR-style Ethernet plug with a normal socket for troubleshooting, you can unscrew the shell by hand to reveal a conventional RJ45 plug.  Don't lose the shell.  RJ45 connectors don't react well to mud or having their tabs snapped off, so it's worth having a spare Ethernet cable to hand.

### Laptop power supply

The delicate Acer 3x1.1mm DC barrel connector is a conspicuous single point of failure.  Treat it with care.  A adaptor to allow the use of a standard USB-C laptop power supply is in the laptop bag (the Acer laptop cannot accept power on its USB-C port).
