# Options

## Play Sounds
Toggles whether SprintTimer makes sounds during sprints.  These are useful as reassurance that the timer and RFID reader are operating when not looking at the screen.  Note that the timing 'pips' provide a rough indication of system status, and are not precisely synchronised with the timer.  You should not attempt to estimate a sprint's duration by counting pips!
