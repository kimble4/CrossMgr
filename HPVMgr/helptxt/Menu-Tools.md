## Tools

### Write sign-on sheet...

Writes the sign-on sheet for the currently selected **Event** to disk.  See [Events][] for details.

### Seed race allocation from results sheet...

A wizard that seeds the current [RaceAllocation][] bases on the finish order in a results spreadsheet.  Useful for allocating groups based on time trial results or similar.

This works best if the list of racers is as close as possible to those entered in the current event.  It will not add racers to the event for you, and non-existent racers are discarded, so enter the racers using the [EventEntry][] screen first.
