## Categories

This screen displays the list of **Categories** available in a given **Season**.  The category names will be used to populate the `CustomCategory` fields in the CrossMgr sign-on sheets.  The abbreviations are used for display only.

Select a season using the drop-down at the top of the page.  The categories table may be edited directly.

* The "**Copy categories**" button may be used to copy the table from another **Season**.
* The "**Commit**" button saves any changes to the in-memory database, but does not write them to disk.
