## Categories

This screen displays the list of **Categories** available in a given **Season**.  The category names will be used to populate the `CustomCategory` fields in the CrossMgr sign-on sheets.  The abbreviations are used for display only.

Select a season using the drop-down at the top of the page.  The categories table may be edited directly.  Note that category names are limited to 23 characters in order to to fit inside Excel's sheet name length limit.

* The "**Copy categories**" button may be used to copy the table from another **Season**.
* The "**Add New**" button adds a new category to the table.
* The "**Commit**" button saves any changes to the in-memory database, but does not write them to disk.
