## Categories

This is a simplifed version of CrossMgr's Categories page.

Normally, this will be initialised by the [sign-on spreadsheet][DataMgmt], and you will only need to arrange them into the desired display order (by clicking and dragging the grey square at the start of the row).  If you are not using a spreadsheet, categories may be edited manually.

### New

Creates a new category.

### Delete

Deletes the selected category.

### Categories table 

Column|Meaning
:----|:----
Category type|Either "Start Wave", "Component" or "Custom".  There should be a single Start Wave containing all riders.  Additional categories are optional.
Name|The name of the category.
Gender|One of "Open", "Women" or "Men"
Numbers|A comma-separated list of bib numbers that make up that category.  Ranges (eg. "100-120") are allowed.
Publish|Whether the category will be included in published results.
Upload|Whether the category will be included when uploading results by (S)FTP.
Series|Whether the category will be included when imported by SeriesMgr.

The categories are published in the order in which they are listed.  To change the order, click and drag the grey square at the start of the row.
