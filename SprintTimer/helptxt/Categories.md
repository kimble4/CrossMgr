[TOC]

## Categories

This is a simplifed version of CrossMgr's Categories page.

Normally, this will be initialised by the [sign-on spreadsheet][DataMgmt], and you will only need to arrange them into the desired display order (by clicking and dragging the grey square at the start of the row).  If you are not using a spreadsheet, categories may be edited manually.

## New

Creates a new category.

## Delete

Deletes the first category in the table.

## Commit

Stores any changes made.
